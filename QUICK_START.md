## 🧠 KEY FEATURES

### Emotion Tracking
- **Real-time** emotion detection via webcam
- Tracks: happy, neutral, sad, fearful, surprised, angry, disgusted
- **Visible indicator** shows current emotion during games

### Smart Risk Detection
- **Easy questions failed** = Higher risk weight
- **Emotion changes** during transitions = Risk indicator
- **Combined scoring**: Performance + Emotion + Time

### Risk Assessment
- **Dyslexia**: Reading tasks (LexicalLegends game)
- **Dyscalculia**: Math tasks (NumberNinja game)
- **Overall Risk**: Low (0-29) | Medium (30-59) | High (60-100)

## 📊 RESULTS INTERPRETATION

### Low Risk (Green)
- Good performance on most tasks
- Stable emotions during gameplay
- Age-appropriate responses

### Medium Risk (Yellow)
- Some struggles with specific task types
- Emotion changes during difficult questions
- May need monitoring

### High Risk (Red)
- Significant difficulties on easy tasks
- Frequent negative emotions
- Confusion/frustration patterns
- **Recommend professional assessment**

## 🎯 ALGORITHM HIGHLIGHTS

**Risk Points Calculation:**
- Wrong answer + Negative emotion + EASY question = **+25 points**
- Wrong answer + Negative emotion + MEDIUM question = **+20 points**
- Wrong answer + Negative emotion + HARD question = **+15 points**
- Emotion change during transition + Wrong answer = **+8 points**
- Multiple rapid emotion changes (< 3s) = **+10 points**

**Why Easy Questions Matter More:**
Struggling with basic tasks is a stronger indicator of learning difficulties than struggling with advanced concepts.

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Node version error:**
```bash
node --version  # Should be 20.x or higher
```

**Webcam not working:**
- Check browser permissions (Chrome → Settings → Privacy → Camera)
- Close other apps using camera

**Emotion not showing:**
- Refresh page and allow camera again
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
